    Now go to your To Do page. Do you see it there?<br/>
    <br/>
    Notice that you also have a new notification in your Inbox.<br/>
    This is where you will be notified about new tasks, new comments, changes of status, and so on.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now, when you are done working on a task, just click Done and the creator that sent it to you will be notified.<br/>
    Try it now.
