    Very good!<br/>
    Notice how this task is no longer in your To Do page.<br/>
    <br/>
    To sum up:<br/>
    <ol>
        <li>To Do page is where your tasks are.</li>
        <li>Inbox is where you’re notified.<br/>
            The idea is to keep it clean!<br/>
            Every time something arrives to your Inbox, don’t leave it there - take an action!<br/></li>
        <li>Follow Up is where ongoing tasks you sent to others are.</li>
    </ol>
